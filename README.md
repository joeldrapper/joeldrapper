I’m a full-stack Ruby/TypeScript/CSS Engineer at Prevail — previously at **Clearscope** and **Shopify**. I maintain a few open source Ruby gems such as **[Phlex](https://phlex.fun)** and **[Literal](https://literal.fun)**.

I’m constantly yapping on **[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/joel.drapper.me)** and cohost the **[Rooftop Ruby Podcast](https://www.rooftopruby.com)**.

## Open to work

I’m looking for a new full-time position. If you’re hiring, please [reach out](mailto:joel@drapper.me).
