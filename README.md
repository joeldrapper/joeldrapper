I’m a full-stack Ruby/Typescript/CSS Engineer at Prevail — previously at **Clearscope** and **Shopify**. I maintain a few open source Ruby gems such as **[Phlex](https://phlex.fun)** and **[Literal](https://literal.fun)**.

I’m constantly yapping on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/joel.drapper.me), I write a (very) irregular newsletter, **[Naming Things](https://www.namingthings.org)**, and cohost the **[Rooftop Ruby Podcast](https://www.rooftopruby.com)**.
