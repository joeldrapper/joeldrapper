I’m a full-stack Ruby/TypeScript/CSS Engineer — formerly at **Clearscope** and **Shopify**. I maintain a few open source Ruby gems such as **[Phlex](https://phlex.fun)**, **[Quickdraw](https://github.com/joeldrapper/quickdraw)** and **[Literal](https://github.com/joeldrapper/literal)**. I’m also building a new DOM morphing library, **[Morphlex](https://github.com/phlex-ruby/morphlex)**.

I write a (very) irregular newsletter, **[Naming Things](https://www.namingthings.org)**, and cohost the **[Rooftop Ruby Podcast](https://www.rooftopruby.com)**.
