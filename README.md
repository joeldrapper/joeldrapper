I maintain a few open source Ruby gems including **[Phlex](https://phlex.fun)**, **[Green Dots](https://github.com/joeldrapper/green_dots)**, **[Literal Enums](https://github.com/joeldrapper/literal_enums)**, **[Action State](https://github.com/joeldrapper/action_state)** and **[Ecase](https://github.com/joeldrapper/ecase)**.

I write an newsletter called **[The Abstraction](https://www.theabstraction.space)** and co-host a pair-programming show, **[Naming Things](https://www.namingthings.org)** and a podcast, **[Rooftop Ruby](https://www.rooftopruby.com)**.

I’m open to contracting opportunities related to Ruby / Rails performance, architecture, meta-programming and anything related to my open-source software. Drop me an email if you’re interested.
