I’m a Full-stack Ruby/TypeScript/CSS Engineer — formerly at Clearscope and Shopify. Currently unemployed and [looking](https://twitter.com/joeldrapper/status/1745394125204078723) for my next job. I maintain a few open source Ruby gems including **[Phlex](https://phlex.fun)**, **[Quickdraw](https://github.com/joeldrapper/quickdraw)** and **[Literal](https://github.com/joeldrapper/literal)**.

I write a (very) irregular newsletter, **[Naming Things](https://www.namingthings.org)**, and cohost the **[Rooftop Ruby Podcast](https://www.rooftopruby.com)**.
